            The goal of this assignment is to give you some experience working with HTML, CSS, and publishing to your new website.
            In this assignment you will start to create your website that will be used during the semester.
            You will design a small 4 page website using HTML and CSS.
        </p>

            Level of Experience: I have a bit of experience with HTML but haven't invested deeply
            into HTML, CSS and even javascript. But I am excited to learn more about this language and improve my skill
            in HTML, CSS and javascript
        </p>

        <p>
            CSS Techniques used: Primarily I went and mainly used the Div element
            to give me the box element I needed. Another main technique I used with all of my
            CSS formatting is the ID and Class technique. As I learned more about
            what the two selectors meant, I've implemented them into my stylesheet and not only
            it made my CSS look organized, but it made it easier to work with because I can fix the styling
            in one specific class or ID. Some other techniques I used it using the psuedo class and the margins. I also
            used borders and padding. Overall those techniques were pretty challenging sometimes to work with because
            of the measurments needed to be right for the image or text to look good.

            Description of the Lab: What I liked about the lab is the mass customization
            you have when building your website. You can customize anything on the website starting from
            the background of the page to the font of the text. Some disadvantages is trying to get the margin and spacing right.
            Another is trying to get the image and right to get the right size and resolution.

            The goal of this assignment is to give you some experience working with HTML, CSS, and building a Responsive Web Design that allows the site to be displayed properly on multiple screens and devices.
            This assignment will involve implementing a “single-page design” where the page contains several “virtual pages” inside a single physical page.
        </p>

        <p>
            What have I learned: What I've from this lab is make it web responsive. I learned the method of changing from a desktop to a mobile screen.
            Another skill I have learned and still learning is the measurements that deal with the margins, borders, padding and posistioning.
            Although sometimes the measurements don't show up nicely on the page, I always do a trial and error and make sure my measurements are right
            and have an organized website. Another thing I learned is how to make the forms for a webpage. I looked the W3Schools and saw the different
            tags and choices to use for my form page.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pros/Cons: Some pros about this lab is the ability to decorate your website and have it all on one page. As the directions says to make
            everything on one page its easier making the container so it makes the blocks for your webpage. Another is making classes that works well with your
            desktop and working well with the mobile view. Another pro was the use of being creative with this website. Of course the website would need to be
            appropiate but you can organize it any way you like and make your topic stand out. Some cons about this lab is the measurements and sometimes
            not working when switching to mobile. Although the measurements are correct on the desktop view sometimes the mobile does not resond well with
            the measurements so it is basically trial and error.
