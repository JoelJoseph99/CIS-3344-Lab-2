            Hello Welcome to my page. My name is Joel Joseph as you can see up top. I am currently a Junior at Temple University
            and I am currently majoring in Computer Science. As you can see there are three links that will tell you more about
            me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            We have the about me page which basically explains more in depth about me and what my hobbies, favorite things to do
            and other things.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            The next link that is up there is the Portfolio link. The Portfolio link will contain information about my resume
            and my work expierence. This link will also lift information about my skills, education, and projects I have done.
