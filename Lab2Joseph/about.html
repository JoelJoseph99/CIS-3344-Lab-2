            A little about me, I originally went to school at Montgomery County Community College for two years. I majored in Computer
            Science there and earned an Associate Degree in Computer Science. The reason I chose Computer Science is because I have a
            huge intrest in computers and mainly want to know how does a computer work both the on the software side
            and the networking side. Back in high school I went to a technical school on the side to learn about networking and I knew
            that I would fall in love with computers. After earning my degreee I transfered to Temple University to pursue in Computer
            Science and hopefully land a field in Cyber Security.

            Some of my hobbies is going to the gym at least once a day. Hiking is another great hobby and going out and expierencing the
            outdoors is relaxing and a fun time with friends. I also love to cook whenever I am free. I always had an interest with cooking
            and trying and making different recipies from all over the world is fascinating and delicious when you make it right. Another
            hobby I would do occasionally is play the guitar. Playing the guitar helps me take a mental break and play some
            of my favorite songs that I know of.
